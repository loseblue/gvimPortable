[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mGlobal  [22mfinds  locations of the specified object in C, C++, Yacc, Java,
       PHP and Assembly source files, and print the path name, line number and
       line image of the locations.  [1mGlobal [22mcan locate not only object defini-
       tions but also object references and other symbols.

       [1mGlobal [22mcan treat a source tree, that is,  a  directory  that  has  sub-
       directories  and  source files, as a project.  In advance of using this
       command, you must execute [1mgtags[22m(1) at the root directory of  a  project
       to  make  tag files.  Then you can execute this command anywhere in the
       project.  You need not specify where the tag file is.  Instead,  [1mglobal[0m
       locates it by itself.

       You  can  specify  a regular expression for the [4mpattern[24m.  [1mGlobal [22munder-
       stands two different versions of regular expression syntax:  [4mbasic[24m  and
       [4mextended[24m. The default is [4mextended[24m.

[1mCOMMANDS[0m
       The following commands are available:

       <no command> [4mpattern[0m
              Print  objects  which  match  to the [4mpattern[24m.  By default, print
              object definitions.

       [1m-c[22m, [1m--completion [22m[[4mprefix[24m]
              Print object names which start with the  specified  [4mprefix[24m.   If
              [4mprefix[24m is not specified, print all object names.

       [1m-f[22m, [1m--file [4m[22mfiles[0m
              Print  all  objects  in  the  [4mfiles[24m.  This option implies the [1m-x[0m
              option.

       [1m-g[22m, [1m--grep [4m[22mpattern[24m [[4mfiles[24m]
              Print all lines which match to the [4mpattern[24m.  If [4mfiles[24m is  speci-
              fied, this command searches in the files.

       [1m--help [22mShow help.

       [1m-I[22m, [1m--idutils [4m[22mpattern[0m
              Print  all  lines which match to the [4mpattern[24m.  This function use
              [1midutils[22m(1) as a search engine.  To use this command, you need to
              install  [1midutils[22m(1) in your system and execute [1mgtags[22m(1) with the
              [1m-I [22moption.

       [1m-P[22m, [1m--path [22m[[4mpattern[24m]
              Print path names which match to  the  [4mpattern[24m.   If  no  pattern
              specified, print all path names in the project.

       [1m-p[22m, [1m--print-dbpath[0m
              Print the location of 'GTAGS'.

       [1m-u[22m, [1m--update[0m
              Update tag files incrementally.  This command internally invokes
              [1mgtags[22m(1).  You can execute this command anywhere in the  project
              differing from [1mgtags[22m(1).

       [1m--version[0m
              Show version number.

              are ignored.  Regular expression is not allowed for the [4mpattern[24m.
              This option assumes use in conversational environments  such  as

       [1m-G[22m, [1m--basic-regexp[0m
              Interpret [4mpattern[24m as a basic regular expression.  The default is

       [1m--literal[0m
              Execute  literal  search  instead  of regular expression search.
              This option is only valid when the [1m-g [22mcommand is specified.

       [1m--match-part [4m[22mpart[0m

              only  with  the  [1m-c  [22mcommand with the [1m-P [22moption.  The default is
              [4mall[24m.

       [1m-n[22m, [1m--nofilter[0m

              [1m-g [22mor [1m-P [22mcommand.

       [1m--path-style [4m[22mformat[0m
