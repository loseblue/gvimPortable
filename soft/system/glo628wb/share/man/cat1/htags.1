       [1mhtags [22m[-acDfFghInosTvwx][-d [4mdbpath[24m][-m [4mname[24m][-t [4mtitle[24m][[4mdir[24m]

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mHtags [22mgenerates a hypertext from a set of source files of C, C++, Yacc,
       Java, PHP and Assembly.

       In advance of using this command, you should execute  [1mgtags[22m(1)  in  the
       root  directory of a source project.  Then you can execute [1mhtags [22min the
       same place.  [1mHtags [22mmakes a directory named 'HTML', and puts a hypertext
       in it.  You can start browsing at 'HTML/index.html'.

       Since [1mhtags [22mgenerates a static hypertext as long as the [1m-D [22mor [1m-f [22moption
       is not specified, you can move it anywhere and browse it by any browser
       without any HTTP server.

       This  command has so many options.  If you are new on [1mhtags[22m, it is rec-
       ommended to use the [1m--suggest [22moption.  With that option, [1mhtags  [22mchooses
